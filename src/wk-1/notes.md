Notes on Ruby
=================

- Ruby is a dynamically typed object oriented programming language.  It
is a scripting language - when a new local variable is needed, it is
defined where it is required. It has got mixins which are neither
java interfaces or C++ multiple inheritance.  It is a purely object
oriented, with closures. 

- Classes and Objects are the center of Ruby
  - All values are references to objects.
  - Different objects communicate via method calls or messages.

- Hiding things is essential for modularity

- Object state is private
